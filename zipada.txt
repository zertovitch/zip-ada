What is Zip-Ada ?
=================

Zip-Ada is a library for dealing with the Zip compressed archive
file format. It supplies:

 - decompression for the following sub-formats ("methods"):
     Store, Reduce, Shrink (LZW), Implode, Deflate, BZip2 and LZMA
 - decryption (v. 2.x)
 - compression (store, reduce, shrink and deflate sub-formats)
 - unconditional portability (see below a list of in-use platforms)
 - input (archive to decompress or data to compress) can be any data stream
 - output (archive to build or data to extract) can be any data stream
 - Zip_info and Zip_Create_info to handle quickly and easily archives
 - cross format compatibility with the most various tools and file formats
     based on the Zip format: 7-zip, Info-Zip's Zip, WinZip, PKZip, Java's JARs,
     OpenDocument files, MS Office 2007+, Nokia themes, and many others
    (see Open bugs list for the rare exceptions)
 - task safety: this library can be used ad libitum in parallel processing
 - endian-neutral I/O

The full source is in Ada: pure Ada, not even a single dependency
to a compiler, a CPU architecture, an OS or an external package or library!
The price for the *unconditional* portability of Zip-Ada hold in these details:
  - archive creation: attributes (read-only, system etc.) are not stored
  - archive extraction: time stamps and attributes of decompressed files
      are not restored as original
That's it!

For details about the code's history, read the file unzip.ads.

Contents
========

* The subdirectory Zip_Lib contains the full source of the Zip-Ada library.
  All you need is there.
  These library sources are in Ada 95, so any Ada 95 and above compiler
  will like them.
  I suggest to simply copy this Zip_Lib folder as a sub-folder of your
  project's sources.
  The library's "front-end" packages are:
    - Zip for some definitions (e.g. the Zip_Info type)
    - Zip.Create for building Zip archives
    - UnZip for extracting files from archives
    - UnZip.Streams for extracting archive entries to streams
  The best to understand how it works is to look at the demos and tools below,
  to begin with Demo_Zip and Demo_UnZip.
  The back-end packages are set as private. You don't need to (and cannot)
  refer to them, even to care of them...

* In the demo subdirectory, you have the following command-line demo
  procedures for testing Zip-Ada:

  - Demo_Zip.adb         : tiny demo for Zip.Create
  - Demo_UnZip.adb       : tiny demo for UnZip and UnZip.Streams
  - Demo_csv_into_zip.adb: demo showing how to produce many files directly
                             into a Zip file, with only 1 temp file
  - Zip_with_many_files.adb

* In the tools subdirectory, you have the following command-line tools
  using the Zip-Ada library:
  - ZipAda.adb           : minimal standalone zipping tool
  - UnZipAda.adb         : minimal standalone unzipping tool
  - Comp_Zip.adb         : tool for comparing two Zip archives
  - Find_Zip.adb         : tool for searching a string across an archive
  - ReZip.adb            : tool for recompressing Zip archives and make them smaller
  
*  In the test subdirectory, there is
  - ZipTest.adb          : test for Zip archive creation with various stream types

*  In the extras subdirectory, there is
  - bunzip               : a standalone decompressor for BZip2 files (.bz2)
  - lzma_dec             : a standalone decompressor for LZMA files (.lzma)

  These demos can be built as main programs. 
  Some are using Ada 2005's Ada.Directories for directory creation (UnZipAda)
  or reading time stamps (ZipAda). A Ada 95-only compiler will protest and
  you can use custom functions instead of the Ada 2005 ones.

  UnZipAda uses a procedure from an extension to Ada.Directories for setting
  time stamps of extracted files.
  This extension in its turn uses a system-specific call.
  You can replace the call to Set_Modification_Time by null
  and remove the line with Ada_Directories_Extensions to get a totally portable
  tool using only Zip-Ada and Ada standard libraries.

* To build the tests, simply "gnatmake" or "adamake" them !
  You can also start "make_za" for minimal effort with GNAT.

  There are also the following project files for building them
  with various systems:
  - ZipAda.gpr for GNAT or the GNAT Programming Studio
  - ZipAda_ObjectAda.prj for Aonix's ObjectAda 7.2.2 and later  
  - UnZipAda_A#.sln for Microsoft Visual Studio and A# (uses files
      UnZipAda_A#.adaproj and UnZipAda_Asharp.gpr)

* The file extensions of source files are GNAT-ish:
  .ads is specification; .adb is body
  Rename the files if necessary, for other compilers.

* You may wish to force text-mode and lower case names (Unix)
  by using unzip's "-aa" and "-L" options: "unzip -aa -L zipada*.zip".

* The Zip format specification is as always in a file called appnote.txt.
  You find a copy within the Zip-Ada pack but might find a fresher
  version here:
  http://www.pkware.com/business_and_developers/developer/appnote/

Other infos are in zip.ads and unzip.ads, specifications of Zip and UnZip
packages.

Latest changes (-!- marks an improvement which brings an incompatibility)
=========================================================================

* Changes in '48', 20-Jul-2014:
  - LZMA decompression significantly faster
  
* Changes in '47', 28-Jun-2014:
  - LZMA method added for decompression

* Changes in '46', 14-Sep-2013:
  - UnZip.Streams decompresses to input and (*new*) to output streams
  - Removed usage of signed integers for stream sizes, increasing
      limits from 2 GB to 4 GB on 32-bit targets
  - Added Zip.Traverse_Unicode
  - UnZip: does not attempt to create empty pathes or drives

* Changes in '45', 22-Dec-2012:
  - Decryption's password check also working for archives encrypted
      by Info-Zip software.
  - Massive speedup when checking files that are invalid Zip archives
      or Zip archives with large comments.
  - Added Is_Open method for File_Zipstream.
  - Zip.Load closes properly the file when loading fails.
  - Improved detection of invalid dates in some Zip archives
      (e.g. wmpChrome.crx Chrome extension).
  - UnZip.Decompress: Optimized calls of feedback: called only when
      1% more done.
  -!- Removed case_sensitive as a parameter in Zip.Exists, Zip.Find_Offset,
      Zip.Get_Sizes, and UnZip.Streams.Open, versions with Zip_Info profiles.
      The Zip_info objects now keep this information in a field after Load.
      Rationale: case-sensitivity mode for search makes only sense when it
      matches the mode used for building the dictionary.
  - Added User_code to Zip_info entries. Can be set and retrieved with the
      Set_user_code and User_code subprograms, or via the Action procedure
      for the generic Traverse_Verbose procedure.
  -!- Improved (if not completed) Unicode support (UTF-8); clearer
      informations about encoding.

* Changes in '44', 3-Nov-2012:
  - The libary provides now a complete toolset for managing Zip archives
      (creating, updating, extracting)
  -!- Zip_Streams: All methods now with pointer-free profiles
  - Zip.Create:
    - new Add_Compressed_Stream for copying entries from an archive
        to another one
    - file modification date and read-only attribute can be passed
        to Add_File 
    - archive creation date is used when entries are added which
        are from a memory buffer (Add_String)
    - compression method can be changed "on the fly", before
        adding new entries
  - Zip.Compress: set a larger, standard output buffer size

* Changes in '43', 15-Sep-2012:
  - Read-only attribute is recognized

* Changes in '42', 30-Jan-2012:
  - Support for Zip archives appended to other files,
        like a self-extracting archive with Zip-Ada in the executable
  - Zip.Traverse (and then Extract all from Zip_Info) uses real file names
        in the case-insensitive mode, instead of UPPER-cased names that are
        there only for dictionary search
  - Some improvements in the ReZip and ZipAda tools

* Changes in '41', 22-Jul-2011:
  - Support for Unicode (UTF-8) entry names within archives; see: Zip,
        Zip.Create, Zip_Streams
  -!- Zip_Streams: Made names more consistent, previous names
        preserved with pragma Obsolescent

* Changes in '40', 1-Mar-2011:
  - New package Zip.Compress.Deflate, with a first (weak but straightforward)
      compression technique for the Deflate format
  - Some improvements in the ReZip and UnZipAda tools

* Changes in '39', 5-Oct-2010:
  - Some fixes in the tools

* Changes in '38', 27-Feb-2010:
  - ReZip: added '-fast_dec' and 'rand_stable' options
  - Zip.Create: fixed major bottlenecks around Dir_entries
      -> 5x faster overall for 1000 files, 356x for 100'000 files !

* Changes in '37',  1-Jan-2010:
  - Minor changes which leads to a significant speedup on GNAT;
      active use of Ada.Calendar can be totally avoided if this is desired

* Changes in '36', 21-Nov-2009:
  - BZip2 method added for decompression
  - Added Zip.Traverse_verbose

* Changes in '35',  2-Nov-2009:
  - *major* performance improvement:
      decompression 10x faster, compression 3x faster (figures for GNAT),
      thanks to a workaround for slow 'Read, 'Write attributes
      in GNAT & ObjectAda
  - ReZip: HTML display improved

      the underlying archive file is also created / closed as well
  - Added procedure Add_String in Zip.Create

* Changes in '30', 7-Feb-2009:
  - Added support for the 64KB-slide "enhanced deflate"
      format number 9 in UnZip.Decompress
  - Added Find_Zip tool
  - Added Demo_csv_into_zip demo (production of numerous files
      into a zip archive)
  - LZ77 output in "Reduce" is cached
  - Added procedure Add_File in Zip.Create

* Changes in '29', 30-Jan-2009:
  - Added Zip.LZ77 and Zip.Compress.Reduce
  - Added an ./extra directory with a tiny LZH encoder/decoder

* Changes in '28', 18-Jan-2009:
  - Fixed bug in UnZip.Decompress, unshrink method, which caused
      truncated decompression for uncompressed sizes more than 512MB
  - Source cleanup with AdaControl 1.10
  - Removed a series of slowdowns and mutually neutralizing bugs
      introduced in v.26, all involving needless uses of
      temporary Stream_Element_Array 's
  - fixed Zip_Streams.Read which read only Item's first element
  - ZipAda uses Zip.Create

* Changes in '27', 10-Jan-2009:
  - UnZip.Extract that used (in v.26) a temporary memory input
      stream (memory hog!) use now a file stream
  - fixed: Zip.Headers.Load for End_of_Central_Dir never
      raised Bad_End even when it had to 
  - fixed: Zip.Find_offset:470 Natural, was Positive (bug in v.26)

* Changes in '26', 30-Aug-2008:
  - zip archive can be any kind of stream (not only a file), for both 
      extraction (unzip) and creation (zip)

* Changes in '25', 1-May-2008:
  - some improvements in the demo-tools, no change in the library

* Changes in '24', 27-Mar-2008:
  - Added case-sensitivity to UnZip.Streams.Open(...)
  - tl parameter is 'out' from 'in out'
  - UnZip.Decompress: hinted compressed size limited to Type'Last-2
      to avoid modular type wraparound
  - Replaced loop in UnZip.Streams.Read by slice copies
  - UnZip.Streams.Read doesn't raise End_Error anymore (it's T'Read's job)
     -> Read is conform to the Ada 2005 standard RM 13.13.1/.2
  - Zip: exception with message

* Changes in '23', 11-Jan-2008:
  - Added a new tool, ReZip: recompression using several zippers
  - Cleanup; buffer-reading up to an eventual end-of-file is simplified,
      now in a new Zip.ReadBlock

* Changes in '22', 14-Dec-2007:
  - Added a new Compose_File_Name to UnZip.File_System_Routines
      see new "-d dir" option in the UnZipAda tool
  - Added Zip.Compress, Zip.Compress.Shrink
      see the ZipAda tool, which has now the light "Shrink" compression

* Changes in '21', 12-Sep-2007:
  - New license: MIT License (more explicit rights, recognized)
  - Password permanent over multiple files (bug appeared in v. 20)

* Changes in '20', 16-Mar-2007:
  - UnZ_Glob, UnZ_IO, UnZ_Olds, UnZ_Infl now sub-packages of procedure
      UnZip.Decompress.Decompress_data (UnZip.Decompress is a private
      child package of UnZip);
      no more global variables, then the library is now task-safe.
  - UnZ_Huft becomes UnZip.Decompress.Huffman
  - Zip_info dictionary tree is now balanced: optimally fast access to
      entries, much faster loading too

* Changes in '19', 9-Mar-2007:
  - New Zip library with Zip stuff concerning not only decompression;
      packages: Zip, Zip.Headers, Zip.CRC

* Changes in '18', 2-Mar-2007:
  - Zip_Headers package replaces of UnZ_Head; this packages not only copies
    various headers from buffers but also directly manages streamed inputs
    and outputs - it can be then also used for writing Zip archives
  - Improved support for 1-pass written archives, without compression
    - needs a hint about "compressed" size! E.g. OpenDocument .ODS

* Changes in '17', 8-Dec-2006:
  - Long file names in sources
  - Cleanup with GNAT GPL 2006 and AdaControl 1.6r8

* Changes in '16', 22-Apr-2006:
  - All I/O via Streams_IO; doesn't help the speed on GNAT and ObjectAda
    but lets room for it, since whole blocks are read and written

* Changes in '15', 28-Sep-2005:
  - Compatible with 1-pass written archives (e.g. JAR):
    fixed parts with data descriptors
  - "Out" parameter flaw not detected by GNAT or Aonix
  - Cleanup with GNAT GPL 2005 and AdaControl 

* Changes in '14', 8-Jul-2003:
  - Cleanup. Looks more like Ada code...

* Changes in '13', 22-Jun-2003:
  -  Fixed workaround for an incomplete d-tree ("Bug" in PKZIP 1.93a &
     a 2001 version of KZIP). Test with "incomplete_d_tree.zip".

* Changes in '12', 13-Dec-2002:
  -   Fixed decryption for 'stored' mode.

* Changes in '11', 29-Nov-2002:
  -   New generic procedure for traversing a Zip directory structure
      As demo, a tool (comp_zip) for comparing two .Zip files, useful
      when combining zip, pkzip, 7zip, kzip and zipmix to shrink archives
      and check them after.

* Changes in '10':
  - improvements around zip_info

* Changes in '09':
  - appended zipfiles (e.g. self-extracting archives) work for "extract_all"
  - tolerance for '/' & '\' in directory names
  - faster recognition of a non-.zip archive
  - procedure Extract_all_files renamed Extract (coherent with
    the other Extract's)
  - test_only option completed with the following:
    - case_sensitive_match : match file names case sensitively; could be
      useful for some operating systems designed before 1980
    - option junk_directories (ignore dir. info : extract to current one)
  - decryption

* Changes in '08':
  - exceptions declarations moved from Unz_Glob to the more public Unzip

* Changes in '07':
  - generic dropped for abandoned implode method (no need for speed)
    -> smaller code
  - UnZ_Olds glues all non-inflate decompressions

* New in `06':
  - Streams implemented (Package Unzip.Streams) !
    see procedure test_unz_streams (teunzstr.adb) for a small example

* New in `05' (1-Dec-1999):
  - changed long_long_integer to long_integer (-> purer Ada 95);
  - demo (unzipada.adb) doesn't use the GNAT-specific `unrestricted_access'
    attribute (-> purer Ada 95);
  - now tested successfully on GNAT/DOS, GNAT/NT, GNAT/Linux, ObjectAda

* New in '04' : 4-Jul-1999:
      Reduce method debugged. Now all PKZIPs from 1989 to 1999 are supported.
      File unzipping is finished and is working.
      User information more complete (see unzipada.adb).
      1st publishing in the Public Ada Library.

* 7-Jun-1999
     Begin of Pascal source translation via P2Ada

Open bugs (as of v.47)
======================

  - PKWARE's pkunzip and ZIP Reader rejects some Zip-Ada's reduce_* archives,
      but unzip <=5.12 and WinZip accept them all
  - Info-Zip's Zip: since data are stored without prior knowledge of size,
      data is stored with a data descriptor after each entry.
      For the "Store" method (no compression), this is problematic
      (no End-of-Stream marker) the size would be needed from the central
      directory for instance. PKZIP and 7-Zip are OK.
  - UnZip.Decompress rejects many "enhanced deflate" (=deflate64)
        files made by WinZip (sometimes CRC errors, or:
    unzip-decompress.adb:1711 Huffman tree errors: huft_incomplete
    unzip-decompress.adb:1542 Inflate_Stored block length check fails
    unzip-decompress.adb:1469 Inflate_codes E = invalid
    unzip-decompress.adb:1809 Inflate_Block block type 3
    )...
    but accepts all archives with the same contents and compression
    method from 7-Zip (7z -mm=deflate64)! Since 7-Zip compresses a lot
    better also with that "enhanced deflate" format, a workaround is
    just to use 7-Zip and not WinZip...
    
To do
=====
  - more profiling - see prof_za.cmd and test/prof.cmd
  - use tasking for decoding in UnZip.Streams, instead of storing
      the whole decoded data in a buffer (this exercise may be difficult!)
  - a Freshen_Zip tool that freshen files from an archive, or files
      to an archive, or both (i.e. like "zip -f" and/or "unzip -f" combined);
      possible with Zip.Create's Add_Compressed_Stream.

To do further
=============
  - Make a public access to UnZip.Decompress, as a zlib proxy
  - Zip.Compress with a strong compression - LZMA for instance ?
