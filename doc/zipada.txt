What is Zip-Ada ?
=================

Zip-Ada is a pure Ada library for dealing with the Zip compressed archive
file format. It supplies:

 - compression with the following sub-formats ("methods"):
     Store, Reduce, Shrink (LZW), Deflate and LZMA
 - decompression for the following sub-formats ("methods"):
     Store, Reduce, Shrink (LZW), Implode, Deflate, Deflate64, BZip2 and LZMA
 - encryption and decryption (portable Zip 2.0 encryption scheme)
 - unconditional portability - within limits of compiler's provided
     integer types and target architecture capacity; see below a list
     of in-use platforms
 - input archive to decompress can be any kind of indexed data stream
 - output archive to build can be any kind of indexed data stream
 - input data to compress can be any kind of data stream
 - output data to extract can be any kind of data stream
 - types Zip_info and Zip_Create_info are provided to handle
     archives quickly and easily 
 - cross format compatibility with the most various tools and file formats
     based on the Zip format: 7-zip, Info-Zip's Zip, WinZip, PKZip, Java's JARs,
     OpenDocument files, MS Office 2007+, Nokia themes, Google Chrome extensions,
     Apple iPhone's iOS App Store Packages,
     E-Pub documents, and many others
 - task safety: this library can be used ad libitum in parallel processing
 - endian-neutral I/O

The full source is in Ada: pure Ada 2005, not even a single dependency
to a compiler, a CPU architecture, an OS or an external package or library.
The price for the *unconditional* portability of Zip-Ada hold in these details:
  - archive creation: attributes (read-only, system etc.) are not stored
  - archive extraction: time stamps and attributes of decompressed files
      are not restored as original
That's it!

Note however that some compilers may not provide the necessary 64 bit
integer types for compiling Zip-Ada. Still, a list of more than 25
successfully tested OS-CPU-Compiler combinations can be found below
under "note on portability".

For details about the code's history, read the doc/za_history.txt file.

Contents
========

* The subdirectory "zip_lib" contains the full source of the Zip-Ada library.
  All you need is there.
  These library sources are in Ada 2005, so any Ada 2005 and above compiler
  will like them, provided it supports integer types up to 64 bit.
  I suggest to simply copy this Zip_Lib folder as a sub-folder of your
  project's sources.
  The library's "front-end" packages are:
    - Zip for some definitions (e.g. the Zip_Info type)
    - Zip.Create for building Zip archives
    - UnZip for extracting files from archives
    - UnZip.Streams for extracting archive entries to streams
  The best to understand how it works is to look at the demos and tools below,
  to begin with, Demo_Zip and Demo_UnZip.
  The back-end child packages of Zip and UnZip are set as private.
  You don't need to (and cannot) refer to them, even to care of them...
  At the very back-end, some components can be used outside of the Zip context:
    - LZ77: a standalone generic streaming LZ77 encoder
    - LZMA[.*]: standalone generic streaming ZMA encoder and decoder

*  In the "demo" subdirectory, you have the following command-line demo
     procedures for testing Zip-Ada:

  - demo_zip.adb         : tiny demo for Zip.Create
  - demo_unzip.adb       : tiny demo for UnZip and UnZip.Streams
  - demo_csv_into_zip.adb: demo showing how to produce many files directly
                             into a Zip file, with only 1 temp file

*  In the "tools" subdirectory, you have the following command-line tools
     using the Zip-Ada library:

  - zipada.adb           : ZipAda, a minimal standalone zipping tool
  - unzipada.adb         : UnZipAda, a minimal standalone unzipping tool
  - comp_zip.adb         : Comp_Zip, a tool for comparing two Zip archives
  - find_zip.adb         : Find_Zip, a tool for searching a string across an archive (contents + names)
  - rezip.adb            : ReZip, a tool for recompressing Zip archives and make them smaller
  
*  In the "test" subdirectory, there is, among others:
  - ziptest.adb              : test for Zip archive creation with various stream types
  - zip_with_many_files.adb  : test archive with a large number of entries - and test limits
  - zip_with_big_files.adb   : test archive with large entries - and test limits
  
*  There are also in "test" the following HAC scripts (or Ada programs, your choice):
  - test_za.adb  : test the ZipAda tool with all supported compression formats, plus Zip and 7Z
  - test_rz.adb  : test the ReZip recompression tool

*  In the "trained" subdirectory, there is trained compression package with examples.
     Trained compression consists in training both sides (encoder, decoder) with
     a data, known in advance to both, which is similar to the data to be compressed,
     transmitted and decompressed. Sometimes the compression ratio is improved significantly.

*  In the "doc" subdirectory you'll find documentation, and research data in za_work.xls .

*  In the "extras" subdirectory, there is
  - bunzip    : a standalone decompressor for BZip2 files (.bz2)
  - lzma_dec  : a standalone decompressor for LZMA files (.lzma)
  - lzma_enc  : a standalone compressor for LZMA files (.lzma)

  These demos can be built as main programs. 

  The UnZipAda tool may use a procedure from an extension to Ada.Directories
  for setting time stamps of extracted files. For that you need to uncomment
  the lines containing "Ada_Directories_Extensions". This extension in its
  turn uses a system-specific call. Without that change, UnZipAda is totally
  portable like the other tools, only Zip-Ada and Ada standard libraries.

* To build the tools, demos and tests, simply "gprbuild" (for GNAT) them with
  the command "gprbuild -p -P zipada.gpr".
  You can also start "opti_za.cmd" or "opti_za.sh" for minimal effort
  with GNAT on Windows or Linux respectively. "debg_za.*" is specifically
  for the Debug mode.

  There are also the following project files for building the tools, demos and tests
  with various systems:
  - zipada.gpr for GNAT's gprbuild or the GNAT Programming Studio (tools and demos only)
  - zipada_test.gpr for GNAT's gprbuild or the GNAT Programming Studio (tests only)
  - ZipAda_ObjectAda.prj for ObjectAda 10.0 and later (tools and demos only)
  - ZipAda_Test_ObjectAda.prj for ObjectAda 10.0 and later (tests only)

* The file extensions of source files are GNAT-ish:
  .ads is specification; .adb is body.
  Rename the files if necessary.

* You may wish to force text-mode and lower case names (Unix)
  by using unzip's "-aa" and "-L" options: "unzip -aa -L zipada*.zip".

* The Zip format specification is as always in a file called appnote.txt.
  You find a copy within the Zip-Ada pack ("doc" directory) but might
  find a fresher version here:
  http://www.pkware.com/business_and_developers/developer/appnote/

* A version of the LZMA specification is to be found in the "doc" directory.

Other infos are in zip.ads and unzip.ads, specifications of Zip and UnZip
packages.

Lionel Matias, for performing extensive fuzzing attacks with "american fuzzy lop"
   on the archive reading / decoding / decompression side, in order to find
   vulnerabilities - and correct them (v.53)

Open bugs (as of v.56)
======================

  - PKWARE's pkunzip and ZIP Reader rejects some Zip-Ada's Reduce_* archives,
      but unzip <=5.12 and WinZip accept them all. Workaround: don't use Reduce
      (unless you build a software with special limited memory requirements):
      this is a very unefficient compression format.

  - UnZip.Decompress rejects many "enhanced deflate" (=deflate64)
        files made by WinZip (sometimes CRC errors, or:
    unzip-decompress.adb:1711 Huffman tree errors: huft_incomplete
    unzip-decompress.adb:1542 Inflate_Stored block length check fails
    unzip-decompress.adb:1469 Inflate_codes E = invalid
    unzip-decompress.adb:1809 Inflate_Block block type 3
    )...
    but accepts all archives with the same contents and compression
    method from 7-Zip (7z -mm=deflate64)! Since 7-Zip compresses a lot
    better also with that "enhanced deflate" format, a workaround is
    just to use 7-Zip and not WinZip for deflate64. If you recompress
    archives with ReZip, you'll see that deflate64 is rarely optimal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note on encryption
==================

1) Passwords should be "strong" to avoid attacks by software that are trying
   many password combinations.
2) A software using Zip-Ada could concatenate a complicated or pseudo-random
   string to a human-entered password, in order to have stronger passwords.
3) Ideally the same password should not be used twice: a Zip archive can
   have a different password for each entry.
4) Data that don't need to by encrypted should not be encrypted.
5) The portable Zip 2.0 encryption scheme is vulnerable to attacks of type
   "known plaintext". See for instance the PKCrack software which relies on
   a pair of compressed data: one encrypted, one not.
   See also the paper: http://math.ucr.edu/~mike/zipattacks.pdf
   Using randomized headers on data to be zipped should prevent the obtention
   of the "plaintext" compressed data (see extras/lz_scramble.ad*).
   A customization of the compression side on Deflate (with randomization of
   the compression structures) could also help.
   Even if password or keys are cracked, point 3) may prevent the decryption
   of other data.

Enjoy!
