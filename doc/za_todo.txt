- LZMA.Encoding & Zip.Compress.LZMA_E: tune performance with well
     placed Inline pragmata

- Zip.Compress.Deflate, LZMA.Encoding and LZ77:
     see also specific "to do"'s in packages' bodies.

- tools: comp_zip: optionally, check only CRC
- tools: comp_zip: optionally or not, compare the compression sizes

- tools: a Freshen_Zip tool that freshen files from an archive, or files
      to an archive, or both (i.e. like "zip -f" and/or "unzip -f" combined);
      possible with Zip.Create's Add_Compressed_Stream.
      NB: AZip does the archive update part; so a command-line invocation
      of AZip would fit this need.

- Make a standalone & generic Deflate, Deflate.Decoding, Deflate.Encoding,
      structured after the already existing LZMA, LZMA.Decoding, LZMA.Encoding.
      This could be used by at least two projects: the Zip-Ada project and
      the Zada project (an implementation of zlib fully in Ada).

- Port PPMd variant I (see attempts in /extras/ppmd_sandbox) or reprogram it
      from scratch (both are tough!), in order to have a complete coverage
      of the Zip format (for compression formats not specialized on specific
      data types) and of compression methods in general.
      A clean reprogramming could cover many algorithms of the PPM family, not only
      the PPMd v.I that is in the Zip archive format.

- more profiling - see prof_za.cmd and test/prof.cmd

- tools: zipada: outputs sometimes progress like this:

  * Would be normal when defaulting to store, but Deflate seems to be chosen in the end.
  * Seems to occurr with data difficult to compress.
  * Compressed archive is OK, only the display is strange.
