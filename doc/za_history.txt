Latest changes (-!- marks an improvement which brings an incompatibility)
=========================================================================

* Changes in '58', 20-Aug-2022 [rev. 922]:
  - Support for Zip_64 archives.
        The Zip_64 format extension is needed when there are more than more
        than 65535 entries or more than 4 GiB data for a single entry's
        compressed or uncompressed size, or for a whole archive.

* Changes in '57', 02-Oct-2020 [rev. 799]:
  - UnZip: fixed bad decoding case for the Shrink (LZW) format,
        on some data compressed only by PKZIP up to v.1.10,
        release date 1990-03-15.
  - Zip.Create: added Zip_Entry_Stream_Type for doing output
        streaming into Zip archives.
  - Zip.Compress: Preselection method detects Audacity files (.aup, .au)
        and compresses them better.

* Changes in '56', 17-Jan-2020 [rev. 780]:
  - Zip: the Zip_info type is now controlled (no need to call Delete;
        additionally, clones are done correctly).
  - UnZip.Streams: added Size and Name functions for Zipped_File_Type.
  - LZ77: added nice simple LZ77 compressor by Rich Geldreich, Jr.
  - (Tools) Added Zip_Dir_List.
  - Some refactoring was needed for -gnatwh warning switch (warnings for
        hiding declarations). Subprogram Create in package Zip.Create
        was renamed to Create_Archive.
  - Adapted to -gnatytc style checks.
  - Better names for some exceptions (the old names
        can be still used); better exception messages.

* Changes in '55', 22-Nov-2018 [rev. 725]:
  - Zip_Streams: ZS_Size_Type is now 64-bit signed, enabling Zip.Create
        to capture archive size overflows in Zip_32 mode.
  - Zip.Create raises Zip_Capacity_Exceeded when archive creation exceeds
        the Zip_32 format's capacity:
        4 GiB total compressed size; 65,535 entries.
  - Zip.Create is now using an Ada 2005+'s Containers's Hashed Maps;
        creation is much faster on Zip archives with many entries.
  - (Tools) ReZip has a new option for working only with its own internal
        compression algorithms - those provided by Zip.Compress.
        This option is useful if external tools are not available.
  - New Trained_Compression package: generic streaming encoder-decoder
        engine with the capability of training the engine with data known
        in advance, in order to achieve better compression. Not Zip-related.
  -!- Minimum required Ada version is now Ada 2005 (was Ada 95 before).

* Changes in '54', 28-Jun-2018 [rev. 637]:
  - Zip.Compress.Deflate: use of L1_tweaked measure; adjusted
      threshold for activating new compression block
  - Source gardening: removal of needless "use" clauses, these cases
      are detected by GNAT Community 2018

* Changes in '53', 14-Nov-2017 [rev. 611]:
  - Decompression and loading of archive directory are more
      resistant to fuzzing attacks. From that version, a random data
      passed as a Zip archive will be either valid (with an extremely tiny
      probability), or, for loading the archive directory, issue
      Zip.Archive_Corrupted. Data extraction will issue one of:
      Zip.Archive_Corrupted, UnZip.CRC_Error, UnZip.Wrong_password,
      UnZip.Unsupported_method, UnZip.Not_supported.
  - Zip.Compress & ReZip: fix in local header generation: EOS flag for
      LZMA format is properly set in any situation LZMA is actually used.
  - (Tools) ZipAda tool has a more useful recursive
      directory search (-r2 option).
  - (Tests) Added Fuzzip, a fuzzing tool for the compression side.

* Changes in '52', 08-Oct-2016 [rev. 557]:
  - UnZip.Streams: all procedures have an additional (optional)
      Ignore_Directory parameter.
  - Zip.Compress has the following new methods with improved compression:
      LZMA_3, Preselection_1 (replaces Preselection), Preselection_2.
      Preselection methods use now entry name extension and size for
      improving compression, while remaining 1-pass methods. 
  
* Changes in '51', 27-Aug-2016 [rev. 475]:
  - LZMA.Encoding has been added; it is a standalone compressor,
      see lzma_enc.adb for an example of use.
  - Zip.Compress provides now LZMA_1, LZMA_2 methods. In other words, you
      can use the LZMA compression with Zip.Create.
  - Zip.Compress has also a "Preselection" method that selects
      a compression method depending on hints like the uncompressed size.
  - Zip.Compress.Deflate: Deflate_1 .. Deflate_3 compression is
      slightly better.

* Changes in '50', 31-Mar-2016 [rev. 383]:
  - Zip.Compress.Shrink is slightly faster
  - Zip.Compress.Deflate has new compression features:
    - Deflate_Fixed is much faster, with slightly better compression
    - Deflate_1 was added: strength similar to zlib, level 6
    - Deflate_2 was added: strength similar to zlib, level 9
    - Deflate_3 was added: strength similar to 7-Zip, method=deflate, level 5

* Changes in '49', 21-Mar-2015:
  - encryption implemented (portable Zip 2.0 encryption scheme)

* Changes in '48', 20-Jul-2014:
  - LZMA decompression significantly faster
  
* Changes in '47', 28-Jun-2014:
  - LZMA method added for decompression

* Changes in '46', 14-Sep-2013:
  - UnZip.Streams decompresses to input and (*new*) to output streams
  - Removed usage of signed integers for stream sizes, increasing
      limits from 2 GiB to 4 GiB on 32-bit targets
  - Added Zip.Traverse_Unicode
  - UnZip: does not attempt to create empty paths or drives

* Changes in '45', 22-Dec-2012:
  - Decryption's password check also working for archives encrypted
      by Info-Zip software.
  - Massive speedup when checking files that are invalid Zip archives
      or Zip archives with large comments.
  - Added Is_Open method for File_Zipstream.
  - Zip.Load closes properly the file when loading fails.
  - Improved detection of invalid dates in some Zip archives
      (e.g. wmpChrome.crx Chrome extension).
  - UnZip.Decompress: Optimized calls of feedback: called only when
      1% more done.
  -!- Removed case_sensitive as a parameter in Zip.Exists, Zip.Find_Offset,
      Zip.Get_Sizes, and UnZip.Streams.Open, versions with Zip_Info profiles.
      The Zip_info objects now keep this information in a field after Load.
      Rationale: case-sensitivity mode for search makes only sense when it
      matches the mode used for building the dictionary.
  - Added User_code to Zip_info entries. Can be set and retrieved with the
      Set_user_code and User_code subprograms, or via the Action procedure
      for the generic Traverse_Verbose procedure.
  -!- Improved (if not completed) Unicode support (UTF-8); clearer
      informations about encoding.

* Changes in '44', 3-Nov-2012:
  - The library provides now a complete toolset for managing Zip archives
      (creating, updating, extracting)
  -!- Zip_Streams: All methods now with pointer-free profiles
  - Zip.Create:
    - new Add_Compressed_Stream for copying entries from an archive
        to another one
    - file modification date and read-only attribute can be passed
        to Add_File 
    - archive creation date is used when entries are added which
        are from a memory buffer (Add_String)
    - compression method can be changed "on the fly", before
        adding new entries
  - Zip.Compress: set a larger, standard output buffer size

* Changes in '43', 15-Sep-2012:
  - Read-only attribute is recognized

* Changes in '42', 30-Jan-2012:
  - Support for Zip archives appended to other files,
        like a self-extracting archive with Zip-Ada in the executable
  - Zip.Traverse (and then Extract all from Zip_Info) uses real file names
        in the case-insensitive mode, instead of UPPER-cased names that are
        there only for dictionary search
  - Some improvements in the ReZip and ZipAda tools

* Changes in '41', 22-Jul-2011:
  - Support for Unicode (UTF-8) entry names within archives; see: Zip,
        Zip.Create, Zip_Streams
  -!- Zip_Streams: Made names more consistent, previous names are
        preserved with pragma Obsolescent

* Changes in '40', 1-Mar-2011:
  - New package Zip.Compress.Deflate, with a first (weak but straightforward)
      compression technique for the Deflate format

  - Zip.Create: fixed major bottlenecks around Dir_entries
      -> 5x faster overall for 1000 files, 356x for 100'000 files !

* Changes in '37',  1-Jan-2010:
  - Minor changes which leads to a significant speedup on GNAT;
      active use of Ada.Calendar can be totally avoided if this is desired

* Changes in '36', 21-Nov-2009:
  - BZip2 method added for decompression
  - Added Zip.Traverse_verbose
  - Added an UnZip.Extract to extract all files, using a Zip_Info variable

* Changes in '35',  2-Nov-2009:
  - *major* performance improvement:
      decompression 10x faster, compression 3x faster (figures for GNAT),
      thanks to a workaround for slow 'Read, 'Write attributes
      in GNAT & ObjectAda
  - ReZip: HTML display improved

* Changes in '34', 12-Oct-2009:
  - ReZip: added '-defl' option for having a recompressed archive only
             with Deflate or Store methods (most compatible)
  - ReZip: added '-comp' option for comparing output against input

  - Added support for the 64KB-slide "enhanced deflate"
      format number 9 in UnZip.Decompress
  - Added Find_Zip tool
  - Added Demo_csv_into_zip demo (production of numerous files
      into a zip archive)
  - LZ77 output in "Reduce" is cached
  - Added procedure Add_File in Zip.Create

* Changes in '29', 30-Jan-2009:
  - Added Zip.LZ77 and Zip.Compress.Reduce
  - Added an ./extra directory with a tiny LZH encoder/decoder

* Changes in '28', 18-Jan-2009:
  - Fixed bug in UnZip.Decompress, unshrink method, which caused
      truncated decompression for uncompressed sizes more than 512MB
  - Source cleanup with AdaControl 1.10
  - Removed a series of slowdowns and mutually neutralizing bugs
      introduced in v.26, all involving needless uses of
      temporary Stream_Element_Array 's
  - fixed Zip_Streams.Read which read only Item's first element
  - ZipAda uses Zip.Create

* Changes in '27', 10-Jan-2009:
  - UnZip.Extract that used (in v.26) a temporary memory input
      stream (memory hog!) use now a file stream
  - fixed: Zip.Headers.Load for End_of_Central_Dir never
      raised Bad_End even when it had to 
  - fixed: Zip.Find_offset:470 Natural, was Positive (bug in v.26)

* Changes in '26', 30-Aug-2008:
  - zip archive can be any kind of stream (not only a file), for both 
      extraction (unzip) and creation (zip)

* Changes in '25', 1-May-2008:
  - some improvements in the demo-tools, no change in the library

* Changes in '24', 27-Mar-2008:
  - Added case-sensitivity to UnZip.Streams.Open(...)
  - UnZip.Decompress: hinted compressed size limited to Type'Last-2
      to avoid modular type wraparound
  - Replaced loop in UnZip.Streams.Read by slice copies
  - UnZip.Streams.Read doesn't raise End_Error anymore (it's T'Read's job)
     -> Read is conform to the Ada 2005 standard RM 13.13.1/.2
  - Zip: exception with message

* Changes in '23', 11-Jan-2008:
  - Added a new tool, ReZip: recompression using several zippers
  - Cleanup; buffer-reading up to an eventual end-of-file is simplified,
      now in a new Zip.ReadBlock

* Changes in '22', 14-Dec-2007:
  - Added a new Compose_File_Name to UnZip.File_System_Routines
      see new "-d dir" option in the UnZipAda tool
  - Added Zip.Compress, Zip.Compress.Shrink
      see the ZipAda tool, which has now the light "Shrink" compression

* Changes in '21', 12-Sep-2007:
  - New license: MIT License (more explicit rights, recognized)
  - Password permanent over multiple files (bug appeared in v. 20)

* Changes in '20', 16-Mar-2007:
  - UnZ_Glob, UnZ_IO, UnZ_Olds, UnZ_Infl now sub-packages of procedure
      UnZip.Decompress.Decompress_data (UnZip.Decompress is a private
      child package of UnZip);
      no more global variables, then the library is now task-safe.
  - UnZ_Huft becomes UnZip.Decompress.Huffman
  - Zip_info dictionary tree is now balanced: optimally fast access to
      entries, much faster loading too

* Changes in '19', 9-Mar-2007:
  - New Zip library with Zip stuff concerning not only decompression;
      packages: Zip, Zip.Headers, Zip.CRC

* Changes in '18', 2-Mar-2007:
  - Zip_Headers package replaces of UnZ_Head; this packages not only copies
    various headers from buffers but also directly manages streamed inputs
    and outputs - it can be then also used for writing Zip archives
  - Improved support for 1-pass written archives, without compression
    - needs a hint about "compressed" size! E.g. OpenDocument .ODS

* Changes in '17', 8-Dec-2006:
  - Long file names in sources
  - Cleanup with GNAT GPL 2006 and AdaControl 1.6r8

* Changes in '16', 22-Apr-2006:
  - All I/O via Streams_IO; doesn't help the speed on GNAT and ObjectAda
    but lets room for it, since whole blocks are read and written

* Changes in '15', 28-Sep-2005:
  - Compatible with 1-pass written archives (e.g. JAR):
    fixed parts with data descriptors
  - "Out" parameter flaw not detected by GNAT or Aonix
  - Cleanup with GNAT GPL 2005 and AdaControl 

* Changes in '14', 8-Jul-2003:
  - Cleanup. Looks more like Ada code...

* Changes in '13', 22-Jun-2003:
  -  Fixed workaround for an incomplete d-tree ("Bug" in PKZIP 1.93a &
     a 2001 version of KZIP). Test with "incomplete_d_tree.zip".

* Changes in '12', 13-Dec-2002:
  -   Fixed decryption for 'stored' mode.

* Changes in '11', 29-Nov-2002:
  -   New generic procedure for traversing a Zip directory structure
      As demo, a tool (comp_zip) for comparing two .Zip files, useful
      when combining zip, pkzip, 7zip, kzip and zipmix to shrink archives
      and check them after.

* Changes in '10':
  - improvements around zip_info

* Changes in '09':
  - appended zipfiles (e.g. self-extracting archives) work for "extract_all"
  - tolerance for '/' & '\' in directory names
  - faster recognition of a non-.zip archive
  - procedure Extract_all_files renamed Extract (coherent with
    the other Extract's)
  - test_only option completed with the following:
    - case_sensitive_match : match file names case sensitively; could be
      useful for some operating systems designed before 1980
    - option junk_directories (ignore dir. info : extract to current one)
  - decryption

* Changes in '08':
  - exceptions declarations moved from Unz_Glob to the more public Unzip

* Changes in '07':
  - generic dropped for abandoned implode method (no need for speed)
    -> smaller code
  - UnZ_Olds glues all non-inflate decompressions

* New in `06':
  - Streams implemented (Package Unzip.Streams) !
    see procedure test_unz_streams (teunzstr.adb) for a small example

* New in `05' (1-Dec-1999):
  - changed long_long_integer to long_integer (-> purer Ada 95);
  - demo (unzipada.adb) doesn't use the GNAT-specific `unrestricted_access'
    attribute (-> purer Ada 95);
  - now tested successfully on GNAT/DOS, GNAT/NT, GNAT/Linux, ObjectAda

* New in '04' : 4-Jul-1999:
      Reduce method debugged. Now all PKZIPs from 1989 to 1999 are supported.
      File unzipping is finished and is working.
      User information more complete (see unzipada.adb).
      1st publishing in the Public Ada Library.

* 7-Jun-1999
     Begin of Pascal source translation via P2Ada
