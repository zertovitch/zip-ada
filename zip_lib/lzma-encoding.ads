package LZMA.Encoding is

  --  Low level: faster but weaker compression
  --  High level: slower but stronger compression

  type Compression_Level is (
    Level_0,  --  no LZ compression
    Level_1,  --  uses Info-Zip's match finder for Deflate (32KB  sliding window), level 6
    Level_2,  --  uses Info-Zip's match finder for Deflate (32KB  sliding window), level 10
    Level_3   --  uses LZMA SDK's BT4 match finder, dictionary's size specified in dictionary_size
  );

    with function  Read_Byte return Byte;
    with function  More_Bytes return Boolean;

  --  (*) In PKWARE's Appnote (5.8.9), the use of an EOS marker is "highly recommended" for LZMA.
  --
  --  NB: the value of uncompressed_size_info actually determines two variants
  --      of the LZMA header, which are *not* compatible with each other!
  --
  --      In .zip files, uncompressed_size_info = False.
  --      This information is already available in Zip entry headers.
  --      In .lzma files, uncompressed_size_info = True.
  --
  --      When uncompressed_size_info = True, this implementation sets
  --      a special size value indicating that the size is unknown.
  --      Reason: size is not known in advance and the header cannot be
  --      rewritten when processing is done.
  --
  --      See also the has_size field of the LZMA_Hints record in LZMA.Decoding.
