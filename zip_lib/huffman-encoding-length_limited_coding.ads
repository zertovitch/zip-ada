--  Huffman.Encoding.Length_Limited_Coding
------------------------------------------
--    This algorithm builds optimal Huffman codes for a given alphabet
--    and occurrence counts (frequencies) of this alphabet. These occurrences
--    are supposed to have been counted in a message to be sent in a
--    compressed form using the Huffman codes. As output, only the bit lengths
--    of the Huffman codes are given; the Huffman codes themselves are built
--    with these bit lengths when the message actually needs to be sent.
--
--  Pure Ada 95+ code, 100% portable: OS-, CPU- and compiler- independent.
