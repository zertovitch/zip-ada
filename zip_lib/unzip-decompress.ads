--  Created 9-Mar-2007
--
--  This package includes the decompression algorithms for methods
--  Store, Reduce, Shrink (LZW), Implode, Deflate, BZip2 and LZMA.
--
--  The package body contains the packages UnZ_IO, UnZ_Glob, UnZ_Infl,
--  UnZ_Olds and UnZ_Misc that were separate in previous versions of Zip-Ada.
--  They became local packages inside the Decompress_Data procedure.
--  Previously global variables are since then local and task-safe
--  with one copy per concurrent call.

  --  When deflate_strict = True, stop if there is an incomplete Huffman
  --  code set for decoding LZ distances. This is the correct and safe behaviour.
  --  When dealing with Zip files from some old compression programs like PKZIP 1.93a,
  --  the check can be bypassed with deflate_strict = False, but this lessens the
  --  data error detection.
